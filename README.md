# Data Collection
## Overview
This repository hosts two interconnected Jupyter notebooks ('part_1_mars_news.ipynb' and 'part_2_mars_news.ipynb'), along with an exported CSV file ('mars_data_export.csv'). The project aims to analyze and summarize data scraped from various websites. The task includes extracting data from a website into a Jupyter notebook, performing data analysis and visualization, and exporting the results to a CSV file.

A notable aspect of this work is the deliberate choice of color palette used in the visualizations. Rather than defaulting to standard notebook colors, specific shades of green, yellow, blue, pink, and red were selected. These choices are consistent with my previous projects, aiming for a uniform visual style across my portfolio.

## Results
The '11_WebScraping_Challenge' begins with 'part_1_mars_news.ipynb', which extracts titles and preview texts from a Mars-related website. Data is reformatted into a user-friendly list. In 'part_2_mars_news.ipynb', data concerning temperature, date, pressure, and other atmospheric conditions from the Curiosity rover's location is scraped from another source. This data is then processed and loaded into a dataframe for in-depth analysis and visualization. Data types are adjusted as necessary for accurate analysis. The project includes various charts and an accompanying analysis of Martian conditions. Finally, the compiled data is saved in 'mars_data_export.csv' for future reference.

## Usage
To analyze the data, follow these steps:

Open part_1_mars_news.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.

Ensure that the resource and analysis directories are correctly set up as indicated in the script. Adjust if necessary.

Import necessary dependencies such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium before running the cells.

Execute individual cells in part_1_mars_news.ipynb to view the data breakdown and calculations.

Similarly, for part_2_mars_news.ipynb:

Open the file in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.

Check and adjust the resource and analysis directories as needed.

Import required dependencies.

Run cells in part_2_mars_news.ipynb to see the data analysis, category breakdowns, and associated visualizations.

The results will be automatically exported to the 'mars_data_export.csv' file.




## You can use this file to analyze the data in the corresponding notebook.

1. Open the respective file (`part_2_mars_news.ipynb') in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.

2. Make sure that the resource and analysis directories are congruent within their respective places as listed in the script, if not change the location.
   
3. Cells requiring the dependencies such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium must be imported prior to use.

5. Run individual cells within the (`part_2_mars_news.ipynb') to see the calculations, breakdown by category, or plots associated with this file.

7. Results will be exported from the notebook into the ('mars_data_export.csv') file.
